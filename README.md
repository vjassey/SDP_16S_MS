# SDP_16S_MS
Data and codes related to the MS on holarctic patterns of bacteria in Sphagnum dominated peatlands

# 1. Biogeographic patterns of bacterial communities and biomass
This section includes analyses: 
- alpha and beta diversity distribution,
- bacterial biomass distributon,
- Taxonomic tree of SDPs bacteria,
- Gamma diversity analysis,
- Analyses of ASV specificity,
- PCoA analysis.

# 2. Influence of environmental factors on bacterial communities
This section contains analyses of environmental drivers:
- General dissimilarity modelling (relative abundance and presence-abscence based) (GDM),
- Quantification of bacterial community assembly processes, including the importance of ddeterministic (homogeneous selection, heterogeneous selection) and stochastic processes (drift, limited dispersal, homogenizing dispersal),
- Influence of recent environmental change on bacterial community composition (reciprocal transplant expereiment approach).

# 3. Enzymatic activities
This section includes analyses of enzyme activities across the gradients:
- Changes across bioclimatic regions,
- Linkages with main environmental drivers.

# 4. Structural equation modelling (SEM)
This section includes structural equation modelling analyses:
- Fit of the general SEM model based on enzyme multifunctionality, 
- Fit of SEM models for each individual enzyme,
- Smoothed SEM modelling across the bacterial richness gradient,
- Randomization-SEM excercize.
